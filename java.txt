Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.
 It was developed by Sun Microsystems in 1995 and is now owned by Oracle Corporation. 
 Java is designed to enable developers to write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on any platform that supports a Java Virtual Machine (JVM), without needing to be recompiled.
